# Dialog Box Generator

![Dialog Box Generator Screenshot](screenshot.gif)

Ever wanted to fill your screen with loads of (fake) errors / warnings?

Dialog Box Generator is a (useless) app which serves this sole purpose - it
displays the specified amount of dialog boxes, randomly placing them all over
the screen.

## Usage

Compile the project with `mvn clean build` and run the resulting `.jar`.
